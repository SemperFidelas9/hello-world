# hello-world
Here to learn more about Coding.

SemperFidelas9 here just started working with coding learning with visual studio coding using JavaScript, node.js, and discord.js. Trying to learn more about coding by trying to 
create my own Discord Bot to do what I want it to do instead of installing several Bots to my server. Ive always been fasinated with Coding and wanted to learn.
